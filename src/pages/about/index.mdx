This site is designed to be a single website that can house pretty much everything I want to publicly publish on the internet

### Work
The *Work* section is for my professional connections. I list the projects that I've worked on (searchable by keyword) and give a brief overview of myself.

### Play
The *Play* section is for me to upload cool pics from my travels, cooking failures, and other odds and ends. Basically, my own personal Instagram.

### Thoughts
The *Thoughts* section is for me to publish my ideas on a wide range of things, technical mostly but perhaps some non-technical things too. It shows a most recent section for my posts on load, but you can also drill into a hierarchy that I created for these posts because I love hierarchies.
