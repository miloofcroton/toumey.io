(Pictured: Rocky doing a training montage)

It's been a long time since I competed in a powerlifting meet last April. First, my gym closed. Then, I took a month to travel around Europe. Then, I went to an intense coding bootcamp. Then, I was unemployed for three months. These are all excuses of course, but training wasn't a priority enough to maintain during this time, and I let it slip.

I've visited the gym periodically in between last April and now, but usually I wouldn't have my full strength or I simply wouldn't have the endurance to finish a full workout. The last few times I tried a squat workout, I wanted to puke the entire time.

Anyways, I'm over that now and planning a new program to get me in the gym 3-4 times a week. I used to have my programming given to me, but that was then and this is now.

This is a hypertrophy-focused program.
