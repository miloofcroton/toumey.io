The most interesting thing about this project was the background image selection. The feature will refresh a new image on load, and it will also provide a way to click directly into Google Earth with that region in focus (so you can keep looking around). In hindsight, it\'s a pretty simple concept, but it was something I was learning when I wrote it.
