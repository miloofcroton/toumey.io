This was my third group project at Alchemy Code PDX. My team consisted of two other team members. Together, wrote a complex back end in Express, which was connected to Mongo via Mongoose. Much of the development time was spend writing aggregations, middleware, and end to end tests. In addition, we had a Vue front end that did a few simple things. We rolled our own auth using bcrypt and storing the hashed passwords in our Mongo instance. We practiced good processes, such as git usage, Agile team principles, and test-driven development.
