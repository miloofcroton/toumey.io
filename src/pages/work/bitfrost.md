A ridesharing app that uses Firebase/Firestore to push real-time ride listings to all users, which is visualized with the Google Maps API. Database is stored in MongoDB from a Node/Express backend. GraphQL connects it to a React and Redux structured client side app. OAuth for authentication and a CSS-in-JS approach to UI design. Testing is done with Jest and Enzyme. Built with a small team in less than a week.

side note: I will fix the icons below when I upgrade my site
