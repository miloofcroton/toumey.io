I don't know if I would call it fun, but there's something satisfying about a good day of work.

We had to peel away some siding to fix water damage, and it turned out to be much larger than we thought. Whoever replaced the windows a number of years ago neglected to put flashing back in (why?!), so water basically drained into the wood, giving it a nice, rotten texture.

Some shaky ladders, thorns, headless nails, and beers later, we got the job done!
