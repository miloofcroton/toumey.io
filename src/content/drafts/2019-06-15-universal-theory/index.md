I want to put forth a theory of mine that tries to tie together all of the main categories of mathematics. I was inspired to follow this line of thought because I was dissatisfied with not only my education but with where the state of mathematics was in academia.

connectivity --> logic --> structure --> quantity --> space

├── connectivity
├── logic
│   ├── logic without memory
│   └── logic with memory (code, computation)
├── structure
│   ├── simple operations
│   │   ├── unit translation
│   │   ├── unit rotation
│   │   └── unit reflection
│   └── calculus operations (change)
├── quantity
└── space
    ├── geometry
    └── geometry with non-straight coordinates (topology)


1. series are steps/code
2. series are equivalent to matrices?
3. numbers are made of series
4. distances and angles are made of numbers of unit distances and angles
5. this with non-straight lines is topology
