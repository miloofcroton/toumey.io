I just read an article about [yet another business](https://digiday.com/marketing/digiday-research-huge-personalizing-cafe-experience/) that seeks to use technology to make his customers' lives better. It reminded me of how much of the recent tech boom has been towards making businesses that offer small changes to daily life, often only for select customers.

There's a concept that Steve Jobs understood really well when it came to products. I had to remind myself of the quote, and when I looked it up, I found a treasure trove of them. Notably,

  ```
  What is Apple, after all? Apple is about people who think ‘outside the box’, people who want to use computers to help them change the world, to help them create things that make a difference, and not just to get a job done.
  ```

  Also,

  ```
  I’m as proud of many of the things we haven’t done as the things we have done. Innovation is saying no to a thousand things.
  ```
