I have recently been in a very stressful period of my life.

It all started about a year ago. My grandma passed away (with whom I was very close to), I lost my job, and a girl that I was seeing decided to stop seeing me. This all happened within a week. Just prior, I had been looking at bigger apartments to move into, and it was also going to be my birthday that week. Quite a change of emotion.

After a slow deliberation, I had formed a plan.

- I was going to go to a coding bootcamp in Oregon to accelerate my career, so that I was never in that situation again.
- I was going to re-dedicate myself to physical training and athletics, as it was something I sorely was craving, even with my decent level of activity at that time. And over the next month, I competed in a powerlifting event as well as the Scottish Highland Games (basically throwing around stones and rods attached to stones), and I joined a local MMA gym that I had been thinking about joining forever (but I never thought I had time).
- I was going to do some traveling. I had a unique situation where I had free time (no job), an ability to drop my apartment and not pay for it while traveling (I was moving from Sacramento to Oregon), and enough in savings that I could afford it. I went to Europe for about 40 days and saw I think 20 or so countries.

Then, after my travels, I jumped into the coding bootcamp. I was stressful, and my desire for excellence probably made it a lot more stressful for myself than my classmates' attitudes. I was working on coding roughly 60-70 hours for several weeks at a time. There were brief breaks, but this essentially went on for 6 months.

I was also a stranger in a strange land. I didn't have friends in Portland, so there weren't many people for me to turn to, and Portland itself is a self-admittedly weird place.

After I graduated, I spent 4 months looking for work. This had large peaks and valleys of emotion too. I built a project for a friend's startup company that encompassed a ton of cutting edge tools in the JavaScript world that I wanted to use. There were moments of excitement and long stretches of confusion and challenge, working on unfamiliar technologies and not necessarily finding lots of documentation online. I also found myself in despair about being stuck indoors all day, partly due to the weather, lack of friends, and still a need to complete work.

Things changed when I found the new job though. I started going to the gym in the morning before work, eating right, and getting on a good sleep schedule. I was performing well at work, and I suddenly had lots of new friends. I even had a good fling that lasted about a month.

Three months into the job, I made a surprise choice to move back home, to Sacramento. This was never a consideration for me because I wanted to make my job, the life giver, my #1 priority. However, a feeling arose in me, so I talked to a couple friends about it, and they really encouraged me to just ask and see what my company says. They were very amendable to this change, so I accepted!

I had one last week before finally moving home. There was a big week of meetings that would plan the rest of the year for my development team. From this, I'd have a good roadmap for my responsibilities, which would be enough for me to succeed while 100% remote.

On day two of these meetings, I had a call from a hospice service in California. My uncle/stepfather/godfather Ray was at the hospital, and I was the next of kin they were asking to pursue care. I finished up that week of meetings, and I raced to Sacramento. This was such a positive and yet sad moment for me, since it marked an achievement of the goal I set out to accomplish when I left California, but I knew I was going home to something bad.

When I saw Ray laying in his bed at home at 125 pounds, 60 shy of his normal weight, the fears became real. Within a couple hours, myself and one of Ray's friends had agreed to call an ambulance to take him to the ER. Upon arriving, Ray's heartrate was high, and his blood pressure was low. He was dehydrated, but they couldn't successfully put an IV in him. They immediately started talking about our wishes to rescusitate or not if his heart stops beating.

From that moment until now, 11 days later, I've been the primary person responsible for handling Ray's affairs (not to say others haven't helped out -- I have lots of thanks to give out to friends, family, hospital staff, and others who made these past days easier). We had to put together a will quickly, and we are currently in the process of completing Power of Attorney and a trust for his estate.

I've had to call and/or meet with friends, hospice, hospital staff, skilled nursing facilities, board and care facilities, attornies, insurance companies, federal agencies (Social Security). Aside from making all of these decisions, considering what's best for Ray and what we can afford, it's just been a lot of dialogue. And with that, a lot of managing the emotions of others, many of whom are concerned, stressed, and going through any number of the stages of grief.

One thing I've realized through this process is that my emotions alone affect those around me. If I'm stressed, they're stressed. If I'm sad, they're sad. If I'm strong and clear-minded, they are strong and clear-minded.

I've found myself:

a) handling Ray's medical and personal affairs
b) homeless (I've stayed in hostels and Airbnbs since arriving in Sacramento, while I look for a permanent residence)
c) working 8 hour days, or the equivalent amount of completed work (remotely)

I've found myself hungry, thirsty, sleepy, and flea-bitten, as I navigate these responsibilities.

Personally, I've been dealing with my own emotions, as I was losing perhaps the most influential person in my adult life. I have had a limited amount of time to grieve, given the circumstances.

At some point, I started thinking consciously about that stress, and that's why I'm writing this article.

## Sports

I have loved sports for my entire life. As an adult I've gotten really into powerlifting too, which is something I also did when I played sports and had something to train for. Of course there are lots of physical benefits from lifting, those are not the reason I crave the activity on a daily basis, other than the physical components that lead to psychological development.

I would lift weights even if it did not come with progressive development of my body. It sharpens my mind unlike most hobbies can. The combination of physical and psychological stress during a workout requires fortitude to push through and achieve peak performance.

Stress management is key for someone seeking to be their best. Great efforts create great stress.
